# Astronomical Body Ontology (ABO)

## Description
An ontology offering terms and expressing types of various sorts of bodies in the astronomical environment, i.e., outer space.
Celestial objects, such as asteroids, moons and planets, may be the target of scientific investigation or astronautical operations. Having a structured, coherent, and detailed vocabulary, classifcation, and semantic/conceptual model may support those activities. 

Alternative names for this model may be: Astronomical Object Ontology, Celestial Body Ontology, Celestial Object Ontology.

### Scope
The scope is that of bodies (broadly construed, but mertial bodies more precisely, given the topic) in exo-atmospheric environments.  
A sub-domain, or part of a broader domain, specifically of the astronomical enviroment (i.e. outer space, entirely). As such, it can form part of my [Astronomical Environment Ontology](https://github.com/rrovetto/Astronomical-Environment-Ontology/)

### Purpose
* To offer a set of natural language terms, including category terms, for various types and instances of celestial bodies, such as planets, Mars, particuar asteroids, etc.
* A taxonomy or categorization of types of astronomical bodies
* A global, neutral, and accurate conceptual model of the various astronomical bodies.
* Aiming to express key concepts shared across astronomy communities. 

### Architecture
A self-contained module, usable by itself, but also part of the author's wider [space domain knowledge modeling](https://purl.org/space-ontology) suite of ontologies and other knowledge organization systems.

### Status
* In-progress as circumstances permit. Subject to revision. 
* As a unfunded personal project since inception, continued development is dependent on circumstances. Formal support is needed to complete and sustain development to realize the full project vision. The vision is ambitious, multidisciplinary and detailed. [Contact the author](https://ontospace.wordpress.com/contact) to formally support the project in some way. Donations are welcome at the below web-links.  
* ACTIVELY NEEDING: financial support, employer support, stable environment with resources to development and continue learning, etc.
* Desired as my PhD or other graduate project

## Support / Contribute / Desiderata - How you can help 
As an unfunded personal project, you can help by offerring financial support, employment opportunities, graduate study opportunities whereby this can be part of my thesis or projects, co-authorship on papers or proposal, mentorship, voluntary technical expertise/servies for desired functionalities of my project, relevant datasets to apply the ontology to, and to be a user of the ontology(s).

## Access
* Contact if interested in purchasing use 
* With sufficient formal support, the ontology may become open
